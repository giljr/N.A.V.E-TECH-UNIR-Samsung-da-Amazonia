## Lessons Learned
Here's a brief description:

[TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/) Simulator:
TinkerCAD is an online platform that provides a virtual environment for designing and simulating electronic circuits. It allows users to experiment with various components, create circuits, and simulate their behavior before implementing them physically. This tool is particularly valuable for learning and prototyping without the need for physical components.

Arduino Sockets:
Arduino Sketches are programs written in the Arduino programming language to control and interact with Arduino microcontrollers. These sketches define the behavior of the Arduino, instructing it on how to read inputs, process information, and control outputs.

Electronics Course:
The electronics course covers the fundamental principles of electronics, including topics such as circuit analysis, electronic components, digital and analog electronics, and the use of tools like oscilloscopes and multimeters. Such a course may also involve hands-on projects and experiments to apply theoretical knowledge in practical situations.


## Roadmap

Project # 01 - [01 UNIR - Blinking 8 LEDs](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fYhatzkBG4p-01-unir-blinking-8-leds) - This is The Hello World Project. It simply blinks 8 LEDs at variable speeds.

Project # 02 - [02 UNIR - LCD intro](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/iMBcjtxUw8Y-02-unir-lcd-intro) - This simply initializes the LCD, displays a splash screen, and counts every 1 second on the second line.

Project # 03 - [03 UNIR - LCD menu](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/aNrWzjOpfV9-03-unir-lcd-menu-) - This project simply initializes the LCD and simulates a menu. Part I.


Project # 04 - [04 UNIR - LCD Menu PLUS Button](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/hCIPRuBCSEj-04-unir-lcd-menu-plus-button-) -  This project simply initializes the LCD and simulates a menu.  Part II.

Project # 05 - [05 UNIR - LCD menu Ultimate Version](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/gL5unE1WIcH-05-unir-lcd-menu-ultimate-version) - This project explains how to create a three-level menu and control an RGB LED:). Part III.

Project # 06 - [06 UNIR - Roll A Single Die](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/0fnAGGkzqpq-06-unir-roll-a-single-die) - This project involves interacting with a die; A Single Die Rolls freely;  each time a user clicks the button, the die rolls randomly.
 
Project # 07 - [07 UNIR - LCD menu Ultimate Version](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/kl6VqxzIb4Z-07-unir-lcd-menu-ultimate-version) -  First Project : SNOWFLAKE - Presentation: [CANVA slides](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF1mXAJyeE/Iv0X65QcByHk04a267UFZA/edit?utm_content=DAF1mXAJyeE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
   Date:   6 Dez 2023 

Project # 08

Project # 09 - [09 - UNIR - Simple Semaphore](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/7fPh07cRnWQ-09-unir-simple-semaphore) - The code defines a button pin (BUT) and an enumeration (but_state) for button states: active and disable. It uses INTERRUPTIONS.
